The THIS Task, centered around Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP). I worked with an IMDb movie review dataset containing textual reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels: positive, negative, or neutral. First, I used the nltk library to clean the reviews by removing HTML tags, stopwords, punctuation, and non-alphabetic characters. The cleaned text was then vectorized using TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text, converting it into numerical format suitable for model training. I trained a LogisticRegression model from sklearn.linear_model and evaluated it using classification_report to determine accuracy, precision, and recall. I also created a function to classify custom reviews using the trained model. Additionally, I calculated the total number of positive, negative, and neutral reviews from the data without using machine learning, which provided a quick overview of sentiment distribution. This task showcased how unstructured text data can be converted into actionable insights using NLP techniques.
